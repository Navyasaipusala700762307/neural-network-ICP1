# Description of assignment-1

First question: First part as plain as that, I took two inputs from user and concated them using addition operation along with a space character in between first and last name. For the function string_alternative goes, I simply created a new variable and concated all the even indexed variables to it. As for the calling main, I've used the special variable "name" and created a main function to call the "string_alternative" function as specified.

Second question: I've created an input text file with text in it beforehand and opened the file and read it using open() and read() functions. Thereafter, used the split() function to split the words in the file and stored it in a list. Created a new file named output_file.txt and wrote the count of words and words using count() function.
